## Which Chart is More Suitable for My Data?
💡💹Choosing the appropriate chart for data visualization is crucial in the field of data analysis! Selecting the right chart helps you present information accurately and comprehensibly to your audience. Each type of data requires a unique representation method to gain a better understanding of it.

🔍📈Using the correct chart helps you represent data clearly and interpretably. For example, if you want to compare numerical data, a bar chart or line chart may be suitable. On the other hand, if the ratio or distribution of the data is important, a pie chart or scatter plot may be appropriate.
To assist you in selecting the right chart, I have prepared the following summary, which includes various types of charts and their use cases. The primary goal is to help you choose the appropriate chart for your data.

📊📈📉Depending on your data, some adjustments and modifications may be necessary, which means these charts and summaries are not set in stone! 😊 However, I believe they are a great starting point for selecting suitable charts.
